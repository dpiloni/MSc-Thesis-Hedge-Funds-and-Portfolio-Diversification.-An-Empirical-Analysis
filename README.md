# MSc Thesis | Hedge fund and Portfolio Diversification. An Empirical Analysis
### (Original title: Gli hedge fund e la diversificazione di portafoglio. Un'analisi empirica)

NOTE: the original text is provided in Italian language. However, in this file I present all the key findings of the analysis.

## Overview
* Identified which hedge fund strategies are able to decorrelate from stock and bond markets, especially during bear market phases, and if this feature can deliver benefits to a diversified portfolio (increase of risk-adjusted performance and/or maximum drawdown reduction)
* Managed Futures  and  Equity Market Neutral are the only strategies that show negative or low correlation during market crises
* Decorrelation ability is not a key feature in diversified portfolios: hedge funds seem more useful to boost performance, rather than to represent a well diversified asset class.

## Methodology
In the first step of the analysis, I measure the correlation between hedge fund strategies and traditional markets (stocks and bonds).
Correlation is measured in three different ways:
* Unconditional correlation 
* Conditional correlation, considering bull and bear market phases
* Dynamic correlation, using rolling windows of 36 months.

In the second step, I construct portfolios consisting of equities, bonds, commodities and each of the hedge fund strategies, using multiple objective approach. In particular, I use the Mean-Variance-Skewness-Kurtosis (MVSK) framework by Davies, Kat & Lu (2009).

Finally I measure the performance of the portfolios obtained:
* Risk-adjusted performance, using Sharpe Ratio in the standard and Andrew Lo (2002) version
* Alpha, using Asness (2001) CAPM equation and Fung & Hsieh (2004) risk factor models
* Ex-post performance, calculating maximum drawdowns and Calmar ratios.
