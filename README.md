# MSc Thesis|Hedge fund and Portfolio Diversification. An Empirical Analysis
### (Original title: Gli hedge fund e la diversificazione di portafoglio. Un'analisi empirica)

NOTE: the original text is provided in Italian language. However, in this file I present all the key findings of the analysis.

## Overview
* Identified which hedge fund strategies are able to decorrelate from stock and bond markets, especially during bear market phases, and if this feature can deliver benefits to a diversified portfolio (increase of risk-adjusted performance and/or maximum drawdown reduction)
* Managed Futures  and  Equity Market Neutral are the only strategies that show negative or low correlation during market crises
* Decorrelation is not a key feature in diversified portfolios: hedge funds seem more useful to boost performance, rather than to represent a well diversified asset class
